# Ferret

Working on a 3D Game Engine thing in LWJGL. It's a god damn mess, I'm following ahberjarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/ to get the OpenGL stuff done
There is a spinning cube with a texture sloppily applied. 

# What is Ferret?
Ferret is a 3D "Game Engine" (notice the quotes), written in LWJGL and Java. It uses Lua as a scripting engine. 

# How to use?
I wouldn't if I were you. You can DEFINITELY write something better than this. Trust me. 

# Will this ever get finished?
Knowing my track record, I'll get stuck on animations, or it'll get stuck as a glorified 3D Renderer. Who knows, we'll see. I wouldn't cross my fingers.
